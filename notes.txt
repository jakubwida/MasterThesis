NOTES:

ALGORITHM USES:
	G.Zhang: Precise algorithm to generate random sequential adsorption of hard polygons at saturation
		-in the document there is a list of uses with sources
		-then there is a notion about saturation limit
		-then a little notion about different shapes and their sources.

	Ebeida et al: A Simple Algorithm for Maximal Poisson-Disk Sampling in High Dimensions

TODO:
fix bibliography management so that it only adds it at the end of document, not page
