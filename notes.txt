#TODO:
-add thesis goals into the proposed algorithm section
-??? read it again tomorrow. In particular, see if it makes sense whole, and make changes related to not writing thesis goals at the beginning. And look for places to reference
drciesla's article. Send.
>things to ask aboot while sending:
	-is moving thesis goals enough, or a full restructuring is required
	-should I replace pictures at GPUrsa demo, as the 'after generation' was too cluttered.
		-I have changed captions to be more readable.
	-How and when should I reference [ciesla]? Is it published yet?
//ask in such way that if any of these require changes, then I can change them and re-send later.
